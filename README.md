# JWT Authentication

## Overview

JWT authentication is created by javascript and node.js as a backend service. The main focus of this challenge is user authentication with the concept of json web token and HTTP-only cookies.

It includes the following:

- Backend API with node, express and mongodb
- Routes for sign-up, sign-in, sign-out, profile and update profile
- JWT authentication stored in HTTP-only cookie
- Protected routes and endpoints
- Custom middleware to check json web token and store in cookie
- Custom error middleware

## My process

### Built with

- JavaScript
- Node.js
- Express.js
- MongoDB
- JSON Web Token

### What I learned

I had an understanding of JSON web token theory but through this challenge, I worked with it in an actual situation. Also, review some essential topics of node.js such as routes, controllers, and models.

### Continued development

Implementing client-side features is the next step for this challenge. I'm learning React as a solution for this situation and I will add it if I can.

## Acknowledgments

The idea for this challenge is coming from Brad Traversy and I follow him in most cases. For me, this challenge is a reference for the future that can help me to develop and use it in different ways.
